# NextJS & GraphQL blog

This is a blog to learn the basics of GraphQL made with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) and
[HygraphCMS](https://hygraph.com/).

To get started, you need to create an account in Hygraph. Once you've created it, you have to create a new project and set the public content API to defaults in project settings.

Also, you need to create an `.env.local` in the root of the project and a new variable called NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URI
